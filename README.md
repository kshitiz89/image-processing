## Project title
A rest api resizing images into 100*100px. 


## Tech/framework used
Express JS 
Node.js
Sharp - node modules for resizing images.
ASYNC -  node modules for performing queue based processing of images
MULTER -  for multiple image upload
JEST -  for unit testing

## Features
This application provide token based authentication.Only user with valid userid and password can login. On authentication token is generated for valid session

## Installation
a) Docker
   docker-compose up -->
b) CMD
   i) npm install
   ii) npm start


## API Reference

    a) Method - POST
    b) URL - http://localhost:8081/
    c) Body - {"password":"password","username":"admin"}

II) ImageProcessing - User can upload multiple images(current limit- 20,can be configurable to more),these images are resized and saved in local stora(image/handlers/imageprocessing/processed_images)

    d) Headers - x-access-token - token generated by Login api

## Tests
 CMD 
 a) npm test

## Future scope
a) Authentication 
- encrypt username and password
- validate user in database
b) ImageProcessing
- save the thumbnail on cloud 
- We can send the resized image as reponse.
c) Implmenting loggers
d) Global error handling
e) Creating cd/ci piple line, which will first excute all the unit test cases first, only if all the test cases pass it will perfom the deployment.
f) Cloud based(AWS Lambda) api can be used for better performance.
  - Offers better monitoring and analysis capabilty
  - can be easily scalable in case on high load
